i3wm with conky status bar
===

i3wm and conky setting/configurations files.
Based on [ This ](https://github.com/levinit/i3wm-config "i3wm-config") and I made some modifications and add other things to make it enhanced.

    `cd ~/.config/i3`

- Get the window list jumper script

    `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minos-org/minos-desktop-tools/master/tools/dmenu-i3-window-jumper`

    `chmod +x dmenu-i3-window-jumper wallpaper.sh i3status-conky/i3status.sh`

# Keybindings
The basic key bindings is following:

Also we can use the `Mod+p` to jump to the opened window by searching its title

# Tips
- TeamViewer: Move it to a worksapce(`Mod + Shift + N`) and make it fullscreen(`Mod + f`)
- ScreenShot: Use the ksnapshot launched by DMemu(`Mod + d`)
- Picture Edit: Use the shutter or GIMP
- Lock or quit: `Mod + Shift + q`, then press the corresponding key
- File Explorer: Mod + e, or launch the `nautilus --no-desktop .` in terminal
- Switch to terminal(`Ctrl + Alt + F1~F6`) to close the application:

    When an application overlay the i3 worksapce and can't switch to other workspace,
    and cannot close that application
- It takes a little time to be effect when update the conky status bar configuration
